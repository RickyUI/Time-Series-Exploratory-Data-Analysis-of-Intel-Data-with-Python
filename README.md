# Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis of Intel Data with Python
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on a time series dataset from Intel. Through detailed notebooks, it explores trends, patterns, and relationships over time to derive meaningful insights.

## Language / Idioma
This project and all analysis are written in Spanish.
If you prefer, you can contact me for any help or translation.

## Objectives
- Analyze data quality and temporal structure.
- Visualize distributions and correlations in the time series.
- Extract actionable insights relevant to Intel’s time-dependent data.
